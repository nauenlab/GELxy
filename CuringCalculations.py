# There are losses in the light path above the objective but these should be consistent across experiments as long as we don't 
# change any aspect of the path. So we can assume 'all' of the light from the lamp comes through the objective.  Things that 
# may vary are the lamp power, the motor speeds, and the height of the gel.  If we lower the gel we increase the diameter of the beam, 
# but the total number of photons hitting the illuminated circle is the same â€“ a point receives the same number of photons while 
# traversing the beam diameter whether the diameter is 100 or 200 microns.  So we can express the light exposure of any point on a 
# gel as lamp power in milliwatts and the number of beam diameters (aka spot diameters) that point is exposed to during spot curing.
# Exposure = lamp power x speed (spot diameters/second) x seconds in the spot

# Examples
# Lanp 1000 mW, field diameter 200 microns, speed of the point 2 microns per second. Time within the spot is 10 s. 
# The point would need 100 seconds to traverse the spot, so in 10 s it covers 1/10th of spot diameter.  So it gets 100mW-diameters
# worth of photons. If it was in the beam for 100 seconds that equates to traveling one full diameter, that would be 1000 
# mW-diameters exposure. If the gel is lowered so the beam expands to 300 microns diameter, and the point of interest is still moving
#  at 2 microns per second, in 150 seconds it would get a full diameter, 1000 mW-diameters exposure, in 100 s 667 mW-diameters.

# Amendment
# I realized the first formulation doesn't account for a point that is stationary.
# we can use a point's speed (a function of the activity of the two motors) and the spot diameter to determine the time that 
# point spends within the illumination spot. dividing the lamp power by the spot area accounts for how the photons are more spread 
# when the gel is further below the objective and the spot is bigger, and more concentrated when the spot is smaller.
# the light exposure of any point is simply (lamp power/spot area)x(time in spot)
# please let me know your thoughts
# thanks



# Goal: Find time t (seconds) the light is in a spot  
# First, we need to map out the beam diameter for different stage heights. This will allow us to create a function of the beam diameter that can be extrapolated
# Second, we need to get data on the stiffness of the gel at different light exposures AND different stage heights. I wonder if changing light intensity and light duration will have different effects on the gel.
# Third, we will use the data from Step 2 to create a function that takes the light exposure (time and intensity) and returns the stiffness of the gel. This will be a logarithmic function based on the data collected from Step 2.

# The beam diameter is a function of the stage height. We can use the following formula to calculate the beam diameter at any stage height:

focal_length = 3.7e-3  # meters according to https://bolioptics.com/40x-long-working-distance-plan-achromatic-metallurgical-microscope-objective-lens-working-distance-3-7mm/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA3eGfBhCeARIsACpJNU_o0--oh97gtA9GVT01KWzme-j-V3potb67rwwukO-mjUS3ExgTsRAaAiLbEALw_wcB
# Working distance is focal length (Also tested manually ~3.5mm)
objective_diameter = 1e-3  # mm -> meters. This is the smallest diameter of the beam before it reaches the objective. Becuase of the washer in the objective lens (1mm Diameter), this is set to 1mm
distance_from_lens = 9.7e-3  # mm -> meters. This is a test distance. The distance from focal point will be -6e-3
waist_radius = (2 * wavelength * focal_length) / (math.pi * objective_diameter)
rayleigh_range = (math.pi * waist_radius**2) / wavelength # https://www.rp-photonics.com/rayleigh_length.html
distance_from_focal_point = focal_length - distance_from_lens
beam_diameter = 2 * waist_radius * math.sqrt(1 + (distance_from_focal_point / rayleigh_range)**2) # meters

print(beam_diameter) 



# We can use the following formula to calculate the area of the beam at any stage height:
beam_area = math.pi * (beam_diameter / 2)**2


# We can use the following formula to calculate the time the light is in a spot:
# time_in_spot = beam_area / speed
# where beam_area is the area of the beam and speed is the speed of the point
# We can use the following formula to calculate the light exposure of any point:
# light_exposure = (lamp_power / beam_area) * time_in_spot
# where lamp_power is the power of the lamp
# We can use the following formula to calculate the stiffness of the gel:
# stiffness = f(light_exposure)
# where f is a function that takes light_exposure as input and returns the stiffness of the gel
