# GELxy

This repository contains code to control two Thorlabs KDC101 motors for creating 2D patterns using a Thorlabs SOLIS-445C lamp. It also includes optical elements for analytics using a Raspberry Pi camera.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Windows Operating System
* Python 3.10 or higher
* [Thorlabs Kinesis Software Development Kit](https://www.thorlabs.com/software_pages/viewsoftwarepage.cfm?code=Motion_Control)
* Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi camera module (optional)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Python 3.10 or higher if you haven't already.
3. Install the Thorlabs Kinesis Software Development Kit by following the instructions on the [Thorlabs website](https://www.thorlabs.com/software_pages/viewsoftwarepage.cfm?code=Motion_Control).
4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Run the code and start controlling the Thorlabs KDC101 motors and creating 2D patterns using the Thorlabs SOLIS-445C lamp.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to install packages using pip.
